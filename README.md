# lab

This repository is my personal collection of code snippets, notes, and learning experiments.
I use it to keep track of small pieces of code and concepts as I learn and practice.

## Structure

- **kubernetes/**
  Notes, manifests, and code related to Kubernetes.

- **dsa/**
  Data Structures and Algorithms.
  - **trees/**  
    - *red-black-trees.md* â€“ code snippet for inserting a new node in a Red-Black Tree.

## Notes

I will keep adding:
- Code snippets (DSA, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Short explanations or notes (e.g., AWS concepts like EC2 instance characteristics)

## Purpose

This repo is mainly for:
- Learning and practicing
- Keeping quick references
- Experimenting with small code snippets
